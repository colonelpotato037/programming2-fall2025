		<p>This is a dish made by Vannie for Mika as a late night snack, though every crew ends up taking a bite from it. It’s a pretty simple and straightforward recipe. Even Mika is surprised by how simply stacking ingredients on top of each other could end up taste this good.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Dragon liver: 300 gram</li>
			<li>Potato: 3 ~ 4</li>
			<li>Pickled cabbage: as needed</li>
			<li>Salt: to taste</li>
			<li>Pepper: to taste</li>
			<li>Garlic: 1 ~ 2 cloves</li>
			<li>Dragon Fat: Enough to submerge liver</li>


		</ul>

		<h3>Steps </h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Season dragon liver with salt, pepper, and minced garlic. Feel free to add herbs and spices.</li>
			<li>To make the confit, cover the liver with dragon fat in a large pot and simmer at about 175° Fahrenheit for 1.5 – 2 hours.</li>
			<li>Mash potatoes and season with salt, pepper, and a dash of confit fat. Mix together well.</li>
			<li>Line the inside of a mold with pickled cabbage, then layer the mashed potato mixture and sliced liver confit, pressing each layer to remove any air pockets.</li>
			<li>Fold pickled cabbage over the top of the ingredients and press down firmly (traditionally, a weight is used to press the loaf for 2-3 hours).</li>
			<li>Slide a knife along the edge of the mold and gently remove the terrine. Enjoy.</li>
